<h2>payment sample 1</h1>

<p>This payment methos sample is a sample PHP implementation of a payment processor.</p>
<p>It does not really connecting to anything, it just shows a page where the user can press a button to make the order fail or succeed.</p>
<p>There is also a processing button. When this is pressed the order is set to success only at the next time the hourly cron is called. (which can be 1 minute or 59 minutes from the time the order was created).</p>
<p>This payment sample serves purposes</p>
<p>1. As a sample on how to implement a payment provider for IncraShop</p>
<p>2. As a test implementation to directly make an order fail or succeed when trying to order</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do not install this unmodified in the life environment as customers can buy products without actually paying them.</p>
