ShortDescription: product price calculation based on length * width (area).
Description: An example of a product that has two options, width and height. The actual price is calculated as: 'width*height*product price'. Where the width and height is given in cm, but the price is given per m2.
Installation: Copies the script to calculate the price per m2, and overrides the function incraShop::CalculateProductPriceFromOptions. It creates one sample product "Canvas printing" with those options, that is ready to use.
